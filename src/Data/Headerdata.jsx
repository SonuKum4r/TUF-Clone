        question: "Are these many questions enough for clearing any DSA round?",
        answer: "They cover all concepts, so conceptwise you will be covered in depth as you would have solved 450+ problems. After that, it depends on your skill set, if you can tackle a new problem on the same concept, ideally you should be able to."

        question: "Is this language specific course",
        answer: "Striver has made sure that the lectures are not language based, he teaches you the alogrithms. Post that he writes the pseudocodes, which are language independent. Loops and data structures are similar in every language, so you can always have the articles open on a parallel tab to check the code for C++, Java, Python or Javascript."

        question: "How do I get my doubt resolved ?",
        answer: "If you have any doubts, you can always open the youtube comments, and read through. Mostly all the common doubts are there in the YouTube section. If you still have doubts, we will highly encourage you to use technology, and open Gemini/ChatGPT, and paste the code from our article, and ask them the doubt. This works for most of the use cases. If you still have doubt, you can post on the youtube comments, Striver usually replies if the community has not."
